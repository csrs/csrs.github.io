## Data Analysis projects
I've been learning statistics and data analysis using Python. Here are some projects I've worked on.

#### Computing4Change: Analyzing maternal and infant mortality 

I worked on this during Computing4Change, which is a week-long conference/workshop/group project that uses data science to analyze a pertinent social issue. It was an incredible experience because 20 or so college students and mentors came together to help each other learn these tools and think critically about the issues we were looking at. I looked at how the mother's health insurance (public, private, uninsured) influences her and her infant's chances of survival within the first year of birth, using data from the CDC birth and death records. I subsetted the data mostly with R, and made visualizations with MatPlotLib. See more info in the [blog post](../Computing4Change).

## Programming projects
These are class projects. My favorite project is the Memory/Concentration game because I made it accessible to screen usage and both keyboard and mouse navigation.

* Javascript, CSS, HTML [[Various projects]](https://website-cs290.herokuapp.com) & [[Memory game]](../memory-game.html)

* C++ [[Data structures]](https://github.com/csrs/CS260-data-structures)

## Websites
I worked on these at a web agency that specializes in using the Umbraco CMS. 

#### Design implementation
I alternated my time between bug fixes, feature additions, and implementing new designs. My work involved portions of a page rather than the entire site. I used CSS, C# (Razor), and Javascript. I also did some browser testing, UX design/research, and even converted some of the older sites to be responsive. Here are some of my favorites:
* Leyard [[link]](https://www.leyard.com/) 
    * Homepage slider, product pages
* Grant European Travel [[link]](https://www.getours.com)
    * Header, tour pages, trip boxes
* S.R.Smith [[link]](https://srsmith.com/)
    * Header, product pages
* Celestron [[link]](https://www.celestron.com/)
    * User stories

#### Accessibility-specific work
My proudest work is the accessibility improvements, testing, audits, documentation, and teaching I did. 
* Rivermark Credit Union [[link]](https://www.rivermarkcu.org)
    * Homepage, contact us page, buttons, links, images, etc
* University of Nevada, Reno Office of IT [[link]](https://oit.unr.edu/)

## Other

#### Web design workshops
As part of ChickTech, I led two workshops on HTML and CSS for high schoolers with no prior experience. This experience improved my public speaking, listening, and empathy skills.

#### Short documentary about changes in online education [[link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp7DKzTxFSw)
This video investigates what the future of prestigious higher education might look like if it was online and available to anyone in the world.
