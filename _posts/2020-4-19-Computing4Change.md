This program really taught me how far I can go in a short period of time... how much I can teach
myself, how forgiving I can be with myself when I struggle to understand a new concept, and how
generous I can be with my time by helping my peers.

The most unique part of this program was that each student was there of their own volition. We weren’t
getting paid to be there, we weren’t getting class credit... heck, I did extra work to
make up the week of school that I missed. It was 100% internally motivated.

Even prior to arriving, there were last-minute webinars and tutorials that I had to complete, which
meant I had to add more to my schedule and make sure I was balancing them. Upon arriving, I realized
that I wasn’t entirely sure how much of the end product was in my control. It turned out that it was
100% in my control. There were suggestions (some very strong) of what type of data to look at, which
tools to use, etc, and I did check in with the mentors to get their feedback, but ultimately it was up to
me. 

Something very interesting happened mid-way through the week. I had became frustrated because I
was asked to try some techniques that to me were advanced, something that I hadn’t expected to learn or do that week. It
would be more work, and harder work, than than I expected, but a mentor had suggested
I try it.

At first, I struggled with this because part of me wanted to take the easy way out. I let myself feel
annoyed for a few minutes, and then came to my senses. I didn’t take an entire week off of school just to
do a minimal amount of work, and not push myself as far as I can. 

That evening was spent doing lots of trial and error and searching online to understand how to do this
statistical method. I stayed in my hotel room by myself because I didn’t want to be tempted to let
anyone do it for me. I wanted to struggle for a few hours so that I would at least have some questions to
ask in the morning. In the process, I encountered some things that I would never have run into if I
hadn’t struggled with this - mainly around how to clean the data.

The next morning, I was very nervous because I felt like perhaps I had wasted an entire evening, and
maybe I should have asked someone for help? What if the result I had was statistically invalid? I
showed my work to a mentor and as I explained it, I realized my work was valid, if I just change one
thing!

I usually can’t stay up past a certain hour, but while working on this problem, I consistently stayed up
after that, no caffeine necessary, because I was so engaged and invested in the research. That sort of
intrinsic motivation and ability to choose what direction I take my work (within the constraints of
working on a team) is what I strive for.
