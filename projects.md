## Websites
I worked on these at a web agency that specializes in using the Umbraco CMS. 

#### Design implementation
I alternated my time between bug fixes, feature additions, and implementing new designs. I used CSS, C# (Razor), and Javascript. I also did some browser testing, UX design/research, and even converted some of the older sites to be responsive.
