title: My experience at NEW Leadership Oregon
---

This summer I had the privilege of attending NEW Leadership Oregon, a women's leadership conference hosted by the Center for Women's Leadership at Portland State University. The conference consisted of 6 days of experiential learning in the fields of leadership, public speaking, communication styles, and networking. The conference focuses on the political arena and becoming involved in local politics. Since I’m just getting back into writing, I’ll summarize each day and what I learned. 

### Day One: Welcome and Getting Involved with Politics

The first day, we met the other 60 or so participants and staff. The most interesting take-away from this day was the talk by Shari Dunn, the Executive Director of Dress for Success Oregon. She spoke about the disconnect between how we view non-profits and corporations. It is viewed as less prestigious to work at a non-profit than at a corporation, even if they both do the same work. Why is that? Her theory is that traditionally, women do the nurturing and care-taking work,which is typically what non-profits do. Think food banks, scholarships, charities, etc. They pick up the slack from what society, the government and corporations have failed to provide. And because women’s work (think stay-at-home moms) isn’t considered “real work” we as a society unconsciously assume that organizations that primarily do “women’s” work (nurturing, supporting, care-giving) aren’t doing real work. 

If a non-profit CEO makes 6 figures or earns a bonus, that is viewed as a bad thing. They shouldn’t keep that money. But when the CEO of a corporation does the same thing, it’s just business as usual. We all know that money is what drives innovation, so why shouldn’t CEOs of non-profits be incentive to innovate? To so degree, enough money is enough, but for example, the disparity in how we vilified the CEO of Goodwill having a nearly $1 million salary[1] versus a pharmaceutical company CEO having a nearly $19 million salary[2] is unsettling. 

Here is a recording of her giving a [similar presentation](https://vimeo.com/344722953), showing her slides.

### Day Two: Communication

The first part of the day was a chance to talk openly and candidly about how people with different personality styles communicate with each other. We used the spectrum of Myers-Briggs to cover many aspects of one's personality. Folks who identify strongly with one personality trait shared how being around the opposite trait makes them feel, and how folks of the opposite trait can help them or communicate better with them. It was refreshing because it was a safe space to share how we honestly feel without anyone taking it personally. 

The second part of the day consisted a workshop by Sari De La Motte, a communication coach who specializes in helping attorneys. We practiced things such as body language, hand gestures and tone of voice. Body language is awareness of the situation and your positioning, adaptability to the situation, and authenticity even if it feels new. The two biggest body language takeaways were:
1. When gesturing while talking, freeze your hand position when you pause.
2. When sending information/being authoritative, keep your palms down. When seeking information/being approachable, keep your palms up.

There is a time and place for both authoritative (sending) tones, and approachable (receiving) tone of voice and body language. It is also equally important to be flexible and willing to match the other participants. For example, if you enter a meeting wanting to get things done, but everyone else wants to chit-chat for a while, it will work out better if you go along with it for a while and then transition into "authoritative" mode. 

A large part of her message was on how to be nicer to ourselves (practicing nice self-talk rather than demeaning self-talk). In every situation where I don't know the full picture, I choose what story I tell myself. Why not tell myself a nice one? Self-care should be built into our everyday, not just a band-aid we do when we feel sad.

### Day Three: Working Together and Using your Strengths

The first part of day three was on workplace tactics such as negotiating, what to do if you make a mistake that costs the company money, how to handle someone taking credit for your work, and more. We got direct feedback from women in a variety of fields.

The second part of the day was almost like a group therapy session. The author Reema Zaman shared her story of recovery and resilience. Some takeaways from her talk:
1. Live from the scar, not from the wound. Scar tissue is stronger than regular tissue because it has lived through trauma and came out on the other side. My past traumas are a part of me, but don't define what I can do or what I am allowed to feel. 
2. If you feel scared or ashamed to talk about trauma, it is because somebody or society at large has tried to shame you for the fact that that trauma happened to you, or minimize its effects, essentially saying "you aren't allowed to feel XYZ emotion about it". Acknowledging that opens up the opportunity to heal from it.

The second part of this day, we heard from Laura Nissen, a futurist and social work professor. She spoke abut the importance of:
1. Future technologies taking into consideration everyone's needs, including those who rely on social services,which a lot of future technologies seem to replace (Uber replacing public transportation, private food delivery which don't take food stamps replacing grocery stores, etc).
2. Folks of all disciplines being educated on how the world is going to change, not only those in engineering or software fields. I.e. making sure the people impacted by things like their trucking job being replaced with a self-driving truck aren't caught off guard by it.

### Day Four:

On this day we prepared for our mock testimony day at the capitol. My bill was HB 3031, Paid Family Medical Leave. We heard from one of the sponsors of the bill and came up with testimony and arguments in favor of the bill. I learned that for bills that invole a change in tax code or that have a financial aspect to them, after the bill is passed, there is a period during which the legislature hammers out the financial specifics. 

### Day Five:

Day five was the day we all went to the capitol and got a tour of the building, met Governors Barbara Roberts and Kate Brown (!!!), sat in on part of a legislative session, and gave mock testimony on a current bill. I argued on the "pro" side of HB 3031, Paid Family Medical Leave. The bill had actually already passed, and allows all workers (including farm workers, self-employed people, and part-time workers) up to 12 weeks each year, paid, to attend to medical issues for themselves or a family member. The bill is funded via a tax similar to how unemployment is funded. One of my arguments was that studies show that there is less employee turnover when workers are allowed to take time off to care or themselves without losing their income. I also gave testimony from one of the women in the program, who is to this day still paying off debt she incurred while on unpaid (FMLA) maternity leave 15 years ago. 

### Day Six: Balancing Public and Private Lives

On the final day, we heard from another panel of folks involved with local politics such as Parks and Rec Board, School Board, and Board Commissioners, this time talking about specifics of running a campaign. We learned about the financial of running a campaign, strategies for having a concise message, and how to use your time wisely. 

The second panel of the day was on how to balance one's private, personal life with one's career and/or political life. We acknowledged that for American mothers of color, the idea of doing it all or not being able to do it all has never been a choice for them. They, more than white American mothers, have historically had to work a job in addition to taking care of their kids. 

I recommend this conference wholeheartedly. On the last day, we passed our notebooks around to get signatures like it was a yearbook. We are the NEW Leadership Oregon Class of 2019. 

I learned a lot from the other participants and gained clarity into both my long-term and short-term goals. If I ever decide to run for office, I know that I do belong there and no matter what I pursue, I have a network of women who will support me and can expect the same from me.
