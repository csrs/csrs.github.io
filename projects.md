## Websites
I worked on these at a web agency that specializes in using the Umbraco CMS. 

#### Design implementation
I alternated my time between bug fixes, feature additions, and implementing new designs. My work involved portions of a page rather than the entire site. I used CSS, C# (Razor), and Javascript. I also did some browser testing, UX design/research, and even converted some of the older sites to be responsive. Here are some of my favorites:
* Leyard [[link]](https://www.leyard.com/)  
    * Homepage slider, product pages
* Grant European Travel [[link]](https://www.getours.com)
    * Header, tour pages, trip boxes
* S.R.Smith [[link]](https://srsmith.com/)
    * Header, product pages
* Celestron [[link]](https://www.celestron.com/)
    * User stories

#### Accessibility-specific work
My proudest work is the accessibility improvements, testing, audits, documentation, and teaching I did. 
* Rivermark Credit Union [[link]](https://www.rivermarkcu.org)
    * Homepage, contact us page, buttons, links, images, etc
* University of Nevada, Reno Office of IT [[link]](https://oit.unr.edu/)
